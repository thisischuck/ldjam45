The "outside" limbs should be darker not lighter

high attack animation. In the first hit you should see the back of him. Cause it doesn't make sense that he moves so little on the first hit
and so much on the second.

The idle is good.

The movement feels more like he is walking. Also arms should move diferently
So should do another that shows him running.

Completely redo low attack
